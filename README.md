# Data_Bowl_Tackles

Here is the code I created for my submission in the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl. This code includes a function to clean the data and create tracking level statistics, code for two QDA models and a few visuals to help communicate the results of the metric I created. 

The data loaded into the file are the same csv files taken from the competition website without changes.
